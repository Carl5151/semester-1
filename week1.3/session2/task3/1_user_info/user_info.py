# Week 1.3, Session 2: Write User Information to a File


# Prompt the user for their name, age, and favorite colour.
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
colour = input("Enter your favorite colour: ")

# Open a file called 'user_info.txt' for reading
with open("user_info.txt", "w") as outfile:
# Write each piece of information to the file, each on a new line.
    outfile.write(f"Name: {name}\n")
    outfile.write(f"Age: {str(age)}\n")
    outfile.write(f"Favorite Colours: {colour}\n")

# Hints:
# - Remember to add \n for new lines when writing to files


# Optional: extend this by using a loop to allow multiple people to enter their info in a row
# If you want multiple people to add info without overwriting, consider append mode 'a'
